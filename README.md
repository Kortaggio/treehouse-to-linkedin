# Install instructions

You need to run a static file serve so that CORS doesn't fail when making an API request to the Treehouse server. If you google "how to run a static file serve in ${LANGUAGE_OF_YOUR_CHOICE}" you'll find instructions for doing that. Alternatively, if you like Python, the simplest way to run a static file serve is to use the following command in the root folder:

```
# Python 2.x
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer

# Python 3.x
$ python -m http.server
```
